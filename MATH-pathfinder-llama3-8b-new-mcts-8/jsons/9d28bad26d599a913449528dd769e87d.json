    "query": "What is the maximum number of square inches in the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches?",
    "ground_truth": "Since the perimeter is 12, the sides of the rectangle add up to $12/2 = 6.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $6 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(6 - x) = 6x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 6x = -x^2 + 6x - 9 + 9 = 9 - (x - 3)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{9}$ square inches, which occurs for a $3 \\times 3$ square.",

        "[Reasoning Process]\nTo find the maximum area of a rectangle with a given perimeter, we need to express the area as a function of one variable since the perimeter gives us a relationship between the length and width. Let's denote the length of the rectangle as \\(L\\) and the width as \\(W\\). The perimeter \\(P = 2L + 2W\\) is given as 12 inches, so we have:\n\n\\[2L + 2W = 12\\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for \\(W\\):\n\n\\[W = 6 - L\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a rectangle is given by the formula \\(A = LW\\). Substituting \\(W\\) from above:\n\n\\[A = L(6 - L)\\]\n\\[A = 6L - L^2\\]\n\nThis gives us a quadratic equation in terms of \\(L\\), representing the area. To find the maximum area, we need to maximize this function.\n\n[Verification]\nThe maximum of a quadratic function \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) occurs at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula \\(-b/(2a)\\). In our case, \\(a = -1\\) and \\(b = 6\\), so:\n\n\\[L_{vertex} = -\\frac{6}{2 \\cdot (-1)} = 3\\]\n\nPlugging this value back into our equation for area or recognizing that a square will have the maximum area for a given perimeter, since all sides are equal:\n\n\\[A_{max} = L \\times W = L \\times (6 - L) = 3 \\times (6 - 3) = 9\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of the rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches is when it forms a square, giving an area of square inches.\n\n[Final Answer]\nThe answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
