For example: \"Our objective is to compute the exact value of $\\tan 150^\\circ$ using the unit circle.\"\n\nFirst, convert $150^\\circ$ to radian measure:  Since there are $2\\pi$ radians in a full rotation of $360^\\circ$, we can set up a ratio:\n\n$$\n\\frac{150}{360} = \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}.\n$$\n\nSolving for $\\theta$ by cross-multiplying gives us\n$\n\\theta = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}\n$\n\n* This step is correct, but it would be better to explicitly state the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula: $radians = degrees \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}$.\n\nTo evaluate $\\tan 150^\\circ$, we'll create a right triangle with angle $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ radians as one of the angles.\n\n* This sentence is unclear.

The given angle $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ does not correspond to a $30-60-90$ triangle, which has angles measuring $\\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{\\pi}{3},$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

You should use the properties of the unit circle to find the cosine and sine values for the correct angle.\n\n[Verification]\nThe exact value of $\\tan 150^\\circ$ should simplify to a fraction.\nTo test our knowledge that:\n$\n\\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\n$\n\nconversion into degrees is\n$\n150^{\\circ} \n$\n\nTherefore,\n$\n\\tan (\\theta)= \\tan (150)\n$\n\n* The final verification step is missing.
