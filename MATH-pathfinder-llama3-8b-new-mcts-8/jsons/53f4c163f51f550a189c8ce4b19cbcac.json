    "query": "Louis and Jack are sharing a pie.  Louis eats $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the pie, and Jack eats $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the pie.  How much of the pie do Louis and Jack eat altogether?",
    "ground_truth": "The denominators $5$ and $3$ have a common multiple of $15$.  We use this to write $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{3}{3}=\\frac{3}{15}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot \\frac{5}{5}=\\frac{10}{15}$.  Then, we can add the fractions by adding the numerators and keeping the denominator.  We have $$\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{3}{15}+\\frac{10}{15}=\\frac{3+10}{15}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{15}}.$$",
