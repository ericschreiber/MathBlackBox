    "ground_truth": "First, we note  \\[x^3-y^3 = (x-y)(x^2 +xy +y^2) = 6(24+xy),\\] so we just need to find $xy$ now.  Squaring both sides of $x-y=6$ gives  $$x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 36.$$ Since $x^2 + y^2 = 24$, we have $24-2xy = 36$, so $xy = -6$, from which we have  \\[x^3-y^3 = 6(24 +xy) = 6(24 - 6) = 6(18) = \\boxed{108}.\\]",
