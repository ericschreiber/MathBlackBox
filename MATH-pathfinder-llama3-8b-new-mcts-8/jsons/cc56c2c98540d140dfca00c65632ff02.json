    "ground_truth": "Let the side length of one of the squares be $x$. Looking at the right triangle with hypotenuse $AB$, we have the equation $x^2+(2x)^2=(2\\sqrt{5})^2$ from the Pythagorean Theorem.  Simplifying this equation gives $x^2=4$. Looking at the right triangle with hypotenuse $AC$, we have the equation $x^2+(3x)^2=AC^2 \\Rightarrow AC^2=10x^2=40$. Thus, $AC=\\sqrt{40}=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$ centimeters.",
