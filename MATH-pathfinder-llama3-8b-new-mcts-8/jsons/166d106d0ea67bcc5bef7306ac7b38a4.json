        "To find the integer that lies between $\\sqrt[3]{-45}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{-101}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n## Step 1: Determine the range of the cube root values.\nWe need to understand that as the numbers inside the cube root become more negative, their cube roots move further away from zero in the negative direction.\n\n## Step 2: Find the cube root of -45 and -101.\n$\\sqrt[3]{-45}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{-101}$ will give us two points on the number line. These values are approximately $-\\sqrt[3]{45} = -3.57$ and $-\\sqrt[3]{101} = -4.65$, considering their integer part.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the integers within this range.\nThe integer that lies between $\\sqrt[3]{-45}$ (approximately $-3.57$) and $\\sqrt[3]{-101}$ (approximately $-4.65$) will be an integer greater than $-\\sqrt[3]{101}$ but less than $-\\sqrt[3]{-45}$. This means the number we are looking for is between -5 and -3 (considering integers), which makes it clear that the answer must be in this range.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the exact integer.\nGiven the cube root approximations from step 2, we can determine that $\\sqrt[3]{-45}$'s floor value is $-$4 because when cubed $(-3)^3 = -27$ and $(-4)^3 = -64$, which doesn’t go beyond $-\\sqrt[3]{45}$. On the other hand, $\\sqrt[3]{-101}$’s ceiling would indeed be around that same figure since we are looking for something that fits between these values. This reasoning shows us that our answer must be very near and in fact directly equal to or just above/below -4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-4}$.",
