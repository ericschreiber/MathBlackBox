    "ground_truth": "Since the total distance that I run is constant, the length of each lap and the total number of laps are inversely proportional. Consequently, if each lap is $\\frac{250}{400}=\\frac{5}{8}$ as long, I need to run $\\frac{8}{5}$ as many laps, so our answer is $\\frac{8}{5}\\cdot10=\\boxed{16}$ laps.",
