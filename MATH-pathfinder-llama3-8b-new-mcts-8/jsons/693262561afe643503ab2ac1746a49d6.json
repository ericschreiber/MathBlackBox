    "ground_truth": "Instead of adding large numbers together, we can find the residue for each person for easier computation. We convert the amount they earned to cents and find the modulo $100$ for each.  \\begin{align*}\n2747 &\\equiv 47 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n3523 &\\equiv 23 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n3737 &\\equiv 37 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n2652 &\\equiv 52 \\pmod{100}\n\\end{align*}We want to find the modulo $100$ of the total number of cents. We can add the separate residues to get $$47+23+37+52 \\equiv 159 \\equiv 59 \\pmod{100}$$Therefore, they have $\\boxed{59}$ cents left after converting as much of the money into bills as possible.",

        "[Reasoning Process]\nTo find out how much money was left after the girls converted as many of their coins into bills as they could, we first need to calculate the total amount of money they had in dollars and then convert that total into cents. We also know that when converting coins to bills at a bank, the amount must be an even dollar or more to receive bills, so any remainder in cents after doing this conversion would represent what's left in coins.\n\nFirst, we add up their earnings:\n- Linda: $27.47\n- Sherry: $35.23\n- June: $37.37\n- Connie: $26.52\n\nTotal earnings = $27.47 + $35.23 + $37.37 + $26.52 = $126.59\n\nThis gives us a total of 126 dollars and 59 cents in earnings.\n\nNext, to convert as many coins into bills as possible, we see that they would end up with 126 dollar bills (easy conversion) and then would still have the 59 cents left over because this amount is less than $1.\n\nFinally, since we want our answer in cents, and there are 100 cents in a dollar, 59 cents remains what it is - cents don't need to be converted from themselves into anything else for our purposes here. Thus, after converting their earnings into dollars (bills) and seeing how many were left over as cents:\n\n[Verification]\nThe total money they had was $126.59 which gave them ability to convert 126$ and have the remainder.\n\nThe final amount of cents is simply what is not converted into a dollar bill = 59 cents\n[Final Answer] The answer is 59 \\n#### 59",
