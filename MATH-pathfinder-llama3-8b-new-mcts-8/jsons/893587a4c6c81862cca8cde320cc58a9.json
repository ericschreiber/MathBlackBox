            "I'll provide a thorough analysis of the given answer, pointing out its strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The answer attempts to break down the problem into smaller steps, which is a good approach.\n2. It recognizes that $a$, $b$, and $ab$ are relatively prime to $n$, and uses this information to derive some congruences.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Lack of clarity:** The answer jumps abruptly from one idea to another without sufficient explanation or connection between the steps.\n2. **Insufficient justification:** Some claims, such as \"$\\gcd(ab,n)>2$\", are made without providing adequate reasoning or proof.\n3. **Overuse of congruence notation:** While congruences are a powerful tool in number theory, their use is not always necessary. In some cases, using equality would be more straightforward and easier to read.\n4. **Unclear assumptions:** The answer assumes that $2\\mid ab$ implies $\\gcd(ab,n)>2$, but it's unclear why this should be the case.\n5. **Vagueness about uniqueness of solutions:** The answer mentions that there exists a unique integer solution between -4 and 0, but doesn't provide any justification for this claim.\n6. **Poorly written conclusion:** The final sentence seems to introduce new variables ($a=7,b=-1,n>3$) out of nowhere, which is confusing.\n\n**Major errors:**\n\n1. **Incorrect expression simplification:** In the line \"$(a+b)^{-1}(a^{-1}+b^{-1})\\equiv -(ab)^{-1}\\equiv -2\\pmod n$\", it's unclear why $(a+b)^{-1}$ and $-2$ are assumed to be equivalent modulo $n$. This crucial step needs significant additional justification.\n2. **Misinterpretation of remainder conditions:** The answer seems to imply that the remainder should satisfy a condition ($0<r<n$), but this is unnecessary, as the problem only asks for the remainder when $(a+b)^{-1}(a^{-1}+b^{-1})$ is divided by $n$.\n\n**Improvement suggestions:**\n\n1. **Use clear and concise language:** Avoid jumping between ideas without connecting them logically.\n2. **Provide sufficient justification:** Make sure to explain each step thoroughly, using established mathematical results or lemmas when necessary.\n3. **Clarify assumptions and definitions:** Ensure that all variables are well-defined and assumptions are explicitly stated.\n4. **Organize your work:** Break the problem into clearly labeled sections or steps, with a focus on one main idea per section.\n\n**Score:**\n\nGiven the number of errors and weaknesses in this answer, I would rate it 2/10. While the answer attempts to address some aspects of the problem, it lacks clarity, coherence, and rigorous justification for its claims. With significant revisions, including additional explanation and clarification, the answer could potentially improve.\n\n**Final feedback:**\n\nIt's essential to take a step back and re-evaluate your approach to this problem. Start by writing out clear definitions, assumptions, and justifications for each step. From there, focus on simplifying expressions using standard number-theoretic techniques and results. Verify that all congruences are justified and that any assumptions you make are indeed valid.\n\nBy rewriting your answer with more care and attention to detail, you should be able to significantly improve its clarity, coherence, and mathematical accuracy.",
