    "ground_truth": "A 10-by-12-inch paper will have an area of $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$ square inches. If that paper has 1.5 inch margins on all sides, then the portion of the paper that is not covered by margins will be a rectangular section with length $12 - 2(1.5) = 9$ inches and width $10 - 2(1.5) = 7$ inches. Thus, $9 \\cdot 7 = 63$ square inches of the paper will not be taken up by the margins. Since the paper has a total area of $120$ square in, this means that $120-63=57$ square inches of the page is taken up by margins. Thus, margins take up $\\dfrac{57}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{40}}$ of the page.",

            "[Reasoning Process]\nTo find the fraction of the page area taken up by margins, we'll first calculate the total area of the page and then determine the area occupied by the margins.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total area of the page.\n- The dimensions of the page are given as 10-by-12 inches. Therefore, the total area is $10 \\times 12 = 120$ square inches.\n\nStep 2: Determine the inner (usable) area by subtracting the margins from both sides of each dimension and then multiplying these numbers together.\n- Since there's a margin of 1.5 inches on all sides, we subtract this twice (once for each side) from each dimension:\n    - The length becomes $10 - (2 \\times 1.5)$, which is $7$ inches.\n    - The width becomes $12 - (2 \\times 1.5)$, which is $9$ inches.\n- The inner area is therefore $7 \\times 9 = 63$ square inches.\n\nStep 3: Find the area taken up by margins by subtracting the usable area from the total page area.\n- The margin area is then calculated as $120 - 63 = 57$ square inches.\n\nStep 4: Divide this margin area by the total page area to find what fraction of the page's area is taken up by margins.\n- This calculation yields $\\frac{57}{120}$.\n\n[Verification]\nTo simplify this fraction into a common fraction:\n- We look for any common factors in the numerator and denominator. Both $57$ and $120$ can be divided by $3$, which simplifies our calculation to $\\frac{19 \\times 3}{40 \\times 3} = \\frac{19}{40}$.\nThis confirms that we have found the simplest fraction.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{$\\frac{19}{40}$}\n#### $\\frac{19}{40}$"

        "[Reasoning Process]\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function in the form $y = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$, we look for values of $x$ that make the denominator, $q(x)$, equal to zero while the numerator, $p(x)$, does not.
