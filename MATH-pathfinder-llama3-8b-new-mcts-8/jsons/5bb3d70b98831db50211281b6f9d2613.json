        "## Step 1: Determine the function compositions\nTo find the value of $x$ for which $f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$, we first need to determine the compositions of the functions $f$ and $g$. The composition $f(g(x))$ means applying $g$ first and then $f$, whereas $g(f(x))$ means applying $f$ first and then $g$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate f(g(x))\nGiven that $f (x) = x + 2$ and $g (x) = x^2$, the composition $f(g(x))$ is calculated as $f(g(x)) = g(x) + 2 = x^2 + 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate g(f(x))\nSimilarly, for $g(f(x))$, we calculate $g(f(x)) = (f(x))^2 = (x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the two compositions\nNow that we have expressions for both $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$, we set them equal to each other to find the value of $x$ where they are equal. Therefore, we equate $x^2 + 2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nTo solve for $x$, we rearrange and simplify the equation: \n$x^2 - x^2 + 2 = 4x + 4$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$0 = 4x + 2$\n\nSubtracting $2$ from both sides gives:\n$-2 = 4x$\n\nDividing by $4$ yields:\n$\\frac{-2}{4} = x$\nThus, \n$x = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n## Verification\nTo verify our solution, we substitute $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$ back into both equations:\n\nFor $f(g(x))$ with $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$f(g(-\\frac{1}{2})) = (-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 2 = \\frac{1}{4} + 2$\n\nAnd for $g(f(x))$ with $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$g(f(-\\frac{1}{2})) = (f(-\\frac{1}{2}))^2 = (-\\frac{1}{2} + 2)^2 = (\\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$\n\nIt appears there's been a mistake in the simplification process or the initial verification. Let's reassess the key step of solving for $x$. Starting over from Step 5:\n\nStarting with:\n$x^2 + 2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$\n\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides gives us directly the expression without the quadratic term, and then let's correct the approach by reconsidering our steps.\n\n## Corrected Approach\nWe need to carefully subtract one side of the equation from the other correctly in order to isolate $x$. We should get:\n\n$(x^2 - x^2) + (2 - 4) = 4x$\n\nThis simplifies properly to:\n$-2 = 4x$\n\nHowever; upon revisiting our algebraic manipulations and correcting for the common error of premature solution or incorrect conclusion drawn due from wrong signs application, we now have: \n\n$x=\\frac{-2}{4}$\nUpon this new insight;\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\[-\\frac{1}{2}\\]}.\n#### -\\frac{1}{2}": [

        "## Step 1: Determine the function compositions\nTo find the value of $x$ for which $f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$, we first need to determine the compositions of the functions $f$ and $g$. The composition $f(g(x))$ means applying $g$ first and then $f$, whereas $g(f(x))$ means applying $f$ first and then $g$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate f(g(x))\nGiven that $f (x) = x + 2$ and $g (x) = x^2$, the composition $f(g(x))$ is calculated as $f(g(x)) = g(x) + 2 = x^2 + 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate g(f(x))\nSimilarly, for $g(f(x))$, we calculate $g(f(x)) = (f(x))^2 = (x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the two compositions\nNow that we have expressions for both $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$, we set them equal to each other to find the value of $x$ where they are equal. Therefore, we equate $x^2 + 2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nTo solve for $x$, we rearrange and simplify the equation: \n$x^2 - x^2 + 2 = 4x + 4$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$0 = 4x + 2$\n\nSubtracting $2$ from both sides gives:\n$-2 = 4x$\n\nDividing by $4$ yields:\n$\\frac{-2}{4} = x$\nThus, \n$x = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n## Verification\nTo verify our solution, we substitute $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$ back into both equations:\n\nFor $f(g(x))$ with $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$f(g(-\\frac{1}{2})) = (-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 2 = \\frac{1}{4} + 2$\n\nAnd for $g(f(x))$ with $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$g(f(-\\frac{1}{2})) = (f(-\\frac{1}{2}))^2 = (-\\frac{1}{2} + 2)^2 = (\\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$\n\nIt appears there's been a mistake in the simplification process or the initial verification.

        "## Step 1: Determine the function compositions\nTo find the value of $x$ for which $f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$, we first need to determine the compositions of the functions $f$ and $g$. The composition $f(g(x))$ means applying $g$ first and then $f$, whereas $g(f(x))$ means applying $f$ first and then $g$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate f(g(x))\nGiven that $f (x) = x + 2$ and $g (x) = x^2$, the composition $f(g(x))$ is calculated as $f(g(x)) = g(x) + 2 = x^2 + 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate g(f(x))\nSimilarly, for $g(f(x))$, we calculate $g(f(x)) = (f(x))^2 = (x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the two compositions\nNow that we have expressions for both $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$, we set them equal to each other to find the value of $x$ where they are equal. Therefore, we equate $x^2 + 2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nTo solve for $x$, we rearrange and simplify the equation: \n$x^2 - x^2 + 2 = 4x + 4$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$0 = 4x + 2$\n\nSubtracting $2$ from both sides gives:\n$-2 = 4x$\n\nDividing by $4$ yields:\n$\\frac{-2}{4} = x$\nThus, \n$x = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n## Verification\nTo verify our solution, we substitute $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$ back into both equations:\n\nFor $f(g(x))$ with $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$f(g(-\\frac{1}{2})) = (-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 2 = \\frac{1}{4} + 2$\n\nAnd for $g(f(x))$ with $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$g(f(-\\frac{1}{2})) = (f(-\\frac{1}{2}))^2 = (-\\frac{1}{2} + 2)^2 = (\\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$\n\nIt appears there's been a mistake in the simplification process or the initial verification.

        "[Reasoning Process]\nFirst, let's determine how many perfect squares and cubes are less than or equal to 400.\n\nThere are 20 perfect squares ($\\leq$\\sqrt{400}) and 7 perfect cubes ($\\leq$\\sqrt[3]{400}). We've double counted $1$ (which is both a square and cube), so there are $26$ unique numbers that are either squares or cubes. Now we can subtract this from the total:\n\n$$400 - 26 = 374,$$\n\nThe sequence in question has every positive integer not in the list of squares/cubes: so it's the first $374$ non-squares/non-cubes.\n\nThe perfect squares $\\leq\\sqrt{400} \\le 20$ are:\n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361\n\nThe perfect cubes $\\leq\\sqrt[3]{400} \\le 7$ are:\n1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343\n\nThe non-cubes/non-squares $\\le 20$ are $374 - 18 = 356$. Now we can find the non-square non-cube just greater than 400 which is $401 \\le x <\\sqrt{441} = 21.$ Since $441 > 400$, there exist an extra term in the sequence $2,3,\\ldots$ not in our initial count: namely, $421$. This will give us a total of $374 + 1 = 375$ non-squares/non-cubes.\n\nNow we can proceed with this solution.\n\n[Verification]\n\nThus by verifying it appears that to find $400^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term is nothing but finding the term next to $20^{th}$ term (or) we can compute as  $20 + 380= 400^{\\mathrm{th}}\\ \\mathbf{term}$. To this add the terms between squares in the given sequence, namely: $(22)+23+(26)+(29)+30+31+(36)+(37)\\ldots$ and it will be equal to $\\boxed{\\textbf{421}}$\n[Final Answer] The answer is 421 \\n#### 421": -80.0,

        "[Reasoning Process]\nWe are given the functions $f(x) = x + 2$ and $g(x) = x^2$, and we need to find the value of $x$ for which $f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$. To do this, let's analyze each function composition separately.\n\nFirst, we'll evaluate $f(g(x))$:\n\n$f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = (x^2) + 2$\n\nNow, let's evaluate $g(f(x))$:\n\n$g(f(x)) = g(x+2) = (x+2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$\n\nNext, we set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for $x$. \n\n$f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$\n\n$x^2 + 2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$\n\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides:\n\n$2 = 4x + 4$\n\nNow, subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:\n\n$-2 = 4x$\n\nDividing by 4 on both sides yields:\n\n$x = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify this result by plugging the obtained value for $x$ back into the equations and ensuring they are equal.\n\n$f(g(-\\frac{1}{2})) = f((-1/2)^2) = f(1/4) = (1/4) + 2$\n\n$g(f(-\\frac{1}{2})) = g((-1/2)+2) = g(3/2) = (3/2)^2 = 9/4$\n\nHowever, upon calculating the equations it's noticed that these are not matching, meaning an error. Revisiting each step:\n$x^2 + 2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$.\nThe initial process was followed but in order to have a real solution both sides of the equations were expected to match one more time; subtracting $x^2$ from each side:\n\n\n$2 = 4x + 4$\n\nSubtracting again:\n\n$-2 = 4x$\n\nDividing by 4 and solving for x we will end up at $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n\nHowever the issue persists since this solution causes these equations to be untrue, a more detailed revision of each line would allow us to identify an alternative method or point out that initial mistake if any was performed:\nAn alternative calculation can be applied on the original equality which might help in understanding it. The step that was initially missed is:\n\n\n$f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$\n\n$x^2 + 2 = (x+2)^2$\n\n\n$x^2 + 2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$\n\nA possible rearrangement here would be:\n\n$(x^2 + 2) - (x^2 + 4x + 4) = 0$\n\n$(x^2 -x^2) + (2-4x-4)= 0$\n\n$-4x- 2=0$\nThen proceed to solve for $x$: \n$x=\\frac{-2}{-4}$\n$\\boxed{x=\\frac{1}{2}}$\nNow verifying this newly discovered solution gives:\n\n\n$f(g(\\frac{1}{2})) = f((\\frac{1}{2})^2) = f(1/4) = (1/4)+2$\n\n$g(f(\\frac{1}{2})) = g(\\frac{1}{2}+ 2)= g(5/2)$\nUpon realizing an unexpected result; one could then apply the obtained x-value, then try to solve $f(g(x))=x^2+2=x^2+4x +4$\n\n\nFor a solution $f(g(x)) =g(f (x))$\n\n\nThe step in solving was finding an actual value that will have equality on both sides.\nFurther verification by re-entering the equations results into: \n$f(g(\\frac{1}{2}))=2.25 \\quad g(f(\\frac{1}{2})= 6.25$\nUpon verifying it's observed again not achieving desired outcome. Which now leads to checking possible factorization of equation as $f(g(x)) =x^2+2=x^2 + 4x+ 4$.": -73.532601433419
