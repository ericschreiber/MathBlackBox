        "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nGiven are three equations involving integers $a$, $b$, and $c$: $a + \\frac 1b = \\frac{22}{7}$, $b + \\frac 1c = 8$, and $abc = 21$. We need to find the value of $c + \\frac 1a$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for a in the first equation\nWe'll start with the equation $a + \\frac 1b = \\frac{22}{7}$ and solve it for $a$: $a = \\frac{22}{7} - \\frac{1}{b}$. Since $\\frac{22}{7}$ can be written as $3\\frac{1}{7}$, we notice that in order for $a$ to be an integer, the fractional parts must cancel out.\n\n## Step 3: Find suitable value for b from a\nConsidering the first equation and looking at possible values of $b$ such that the fraction part $\\frac{1}{b}$ cancels out with $\\frac{1}{7}$ so that we're left with an integer. Since we need to cancel $\\frac{1}{7}$, this means $b = 7$ is one possibility because then we'd have a clean cancellation of $\\frac{1}{7}$. As a result, the fraction part cancels out and gives us an integer.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for b using the value found in step 3\nBy substituting $b=7$ into the second equation, $b + \\frac 1c = 8$, we now have $7 + \\frac{1}{c} = 8$. We'll solve this for $c$: $\\frac{1}{c} = 8 - 7 = 1$, therefore $c=1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the third given equation to verify abc equals a whole number and satisfy abc equals 21.\nSince we know that $abc = 21$ from the problem statement, now let's put in our calculated values of $b = 7$ and $c=1$: $a\\times7\\times1=21$, this simplifies to $a \\times 7 = 21$, dividing by $7$ yields $a=3$. Now that we have a value for $a$, let's substitute our found values of $a=3$, $b=7$, and $c=1$ into the initial three equations.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute values into equations to check consistency.\nWe can now see how everything checks out. Substituting our variables in:\nFor equation one, we have: $3 + \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{22}{7}$ which equals $\\frac{21+1}{7}=\\frac{22}{7}$. Then for the second: $7+\\frac{1}{1}=8$ or $8=8$. Now to finish, we multiply them all together and get 21. The integer values seem very feasible.\n\n\n## Step 7: Solve the fourth step equation for c\nSince the goal was finding the expression of c +\\frac 1a using our priorly deduced integer set:\n$c+\\frac{1}{a}$ simplifies to $c+\\frac{1}{3}$.
