        "## Step 1: Recall Vieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial.\nVieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a cubic polynomial $x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0$, with roots $a,$ $b,$ and $c$, we have:\n$a + b + c = -p$\n$ab + ac + bc = q$\n$abc = -r$\n\n## Step 2: Identify the coefficients in the given polynomial.\nThe given cubic polynomial is $x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 2 = 0$. Comparing this with the general form, we see that:\n$p = 7$, which corresponds to the coefficient of $x^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Vieta's formula for the sum of roots.\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c = -p$. Since we identified $p = 7$, we substitute this value into the formula:\n$a + b + c = -7$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-7}$",
